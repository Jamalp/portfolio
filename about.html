            <p class="large-6 columns">I’ve worked through all sorts of jobs and titles in many different industries before I started my wild and awesome journey into web development and the amazing tech scene here in New York City.  I knew I was hooked when “nerding out” started to sound more fun a night out.  I’ve always been really into technology and design but never really had a real outlet for it.
            </p>
            <p class="large-6 columns">I started my professional career in web development in June at General Assembly.  I was blessed enough at that time in my life to be a part of their Web Development Immersive program, which really opened doors for me and gave me the kick I needed.  I spent 3 months hacking all day, everyday. 3 months of staring bewildered at documentation, searching for missing semi-colons and drinking more coffee than I have in my 26 years on this earth.

              <p class="large-6 columns">Deep down I’m an entrepreneur, and I have a couple of side projects that keep my creativity alive. I have a notebook full of sketches, ideas and concepts and am always poking my head into new ventures.  Currently I’m working on a site to showcase and promote a music event a couple of friends are throwing in 2014.
              </p>
              <p class="large-6 columns">Awesome friends, an amazing girlfriend and constant exploration occupy my free time.  I moved to New York from Honolulu in June of 2012 and have been loving every moment of it (except the winters!).  I’m an aspiring everything as I’m insanely curious about every little thing, right now cooking & food are my passions. My bucket list is enormous but traveling is definitely up there, I’ve been to a few of the countries on the top of my list but theres so much more. So don’t call me on holidays, we all have to turn off sometime.
